## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(readxl)
Illinois_and_National_Crime_Stats <- read_excel("Raw Data/Illinois and National Crime Stats.xlsx")
View(Illinois_and_National_Crime_Stats)
```

```{r}

  filter(Year != 2020) |>
  select(Year, Non_Chicago_Reported_TIC, CPD_Reported_TIC) |>
  rename(Non_Chicago = Non_Chicago_Reported_TIC,
         Chicago = CPD_Reported_TIC)
```

```{r}

  #create a dummy variable for when the treatment started
  mutate(time = ifelse(Year > 2012, 1, 0)) |>
  #create a dummy variable for geographic area treated
  mutate(treated = ifelse(Area == "Chicago", 1, 0)) |>
  #create an interaction between time and treated variables
  mutate(did = time*treated)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
